/**
  <summary>
  <para>
  This is a library in the smallest sense: it keeps track of ePub files
  by their unique-identifier, storing the path to that ePub file *as given*. Its
  primary presence here is to allow for inter-publication linking. It is also
  designed to be subclassed in order to serve as the basis of a complete library
  in an application, with all the additional functionality that would involve.
  </para>
  <para>
  Note that each application would have a single library, accessible only through
  the MainLibrary() static method. A library can optionally be written out to
  disk and then loaded back in by calling MainLibrary() with a Locator instance
  at application startup. Once the singleton instance has been created,
  MainLibrary() will ignore its argument and always return that instance.
  </para>
  </summary>
  <remarks>
  Thoughts: OCF allows for multiple packages to be specified, but I don't see any
  handling of that in ePub3 CFI?
  </remarks>
